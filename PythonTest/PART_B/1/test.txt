This is a text file to be used in the program 1.py in the b() function using Counter imported from collections library.
The function opens the file using the open() function and fname  is the name of the file. After opening we are naming it as f.
Thus with the help of Counter() function we are able to get the frequency of each and every distinct word in the file.
